          <p class="lead">Project Transitions is a non-profit organization located in Austin, TX. They provide housing, support and hospice for people with HIV. It is the only direct provider of housing for people living with HIV in Central Texas. For this project, our team was tasked with creating a responsive web design by executing the UX/UI design process. Over the course of 3 weeks, we followed the double diamond design thinking model and UI design process to create a high-fidelity responsive webdesign solution through a clickable UI prototype in Figma.</p>

        <div class="tab-pane fade show active" id="list-phaseone" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="list-phaseone-list">After conducting an initial hueristic evaluation of the website, we then created our proto persona. From this, we started our user research with our hypothesis: we believe that improving the Project Transitions web experience will further education regarding the human immunodeficiency virus, increase charitable giving and activities, and help to strengthen the community around this venerated institution. We then each conducted 6 moderated user research interviews. 

            We asked them questions about their knowledge of nonprofits. If they had any favorites, if they ever volunteered or donated to one before, and if so how often.
             We also asked if they’ve ever heard of Project Transitions, and to tell us about their familiarity with hospice care.
             We then had them browse the current webpage, and to tell us their understanding of what Project Transitions does as a non-profit. Also if they could explain to us the services that were offered, and their overall impression of the organization based on the webpage.</div>
        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="list-phasetwo" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="list-phasetwo-list">From our six interviews, we created an empathy map. This helped us discover our user insight. The key points being that our information needs to be easy to access and navigate. This is important because our users valued the perceived professionalism, fiscal responsibility and overall organization of nonprofits. From our user insight, we derived our problem statement. Most importantly, the current layout, structure and design of project transitions website was not conducive to maximizing user support and engagement. </div>
        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="list-phasethree" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="list-phasethree-list">We started off our ideation phase by creating a story board, user scenario, and user flow. These helped inform our initial paper sketches. We each sketched our own paper homepage for Project Transitions. Together, we began card sorting the current site and created a new sitemap. We then created our new style guide, which we invisioned a modern and updated aesthetic that tastefully added color and vibrancy to the site.</div>
        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="list-phasefour" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="list-phasefour-list">When we began creating our low-fidelity prototypes, we started with a mobile design. We each brainstormed and created our own low-fidelity prototype of the homepage. We brought them together and evaluated the most sucessfull design aspects of each one. We then began to synthesize those into a mid-fidelity mobile prototype. Once we had a single prototype, we began iterating it further and moving towards a high-fidelity mobile prototype. </div>
        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="list-phasefive" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="list-phasefive-list">We tested our mobile prototypes, focusing on the navigation sidebar, legibility of text content on the homepage and the overall UI. We made a few changes after our user testing and then began to expand our mobile design to tablet and desktop size. We continued to get feedback on our design from eachother and users.  </div>
        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="list-phasesix" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="list-phasesix-list">Moving forward, we would like to expand our redesign and iterate the volunteer application flow, the donation flow, and the application for services flow. We would want to spend plenty of time examining our accessibility and conducting more testing. We unfortunately were not able to get in contact with any stakeholders at Project Transitions and it would be great if we could do that at some point in the future.  </div>
